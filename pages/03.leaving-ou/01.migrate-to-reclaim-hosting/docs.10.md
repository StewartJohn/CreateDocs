To migrate your domain from OU Create to Reclaim Hosting, you will need to access your cPanel.  Login at the top right of the page at create.ou.edu (with your OUNetID (4×4) and password).

Once you’re logged in, you’ll see the cPanel interface.  Now click on the ‘Manage Your Account’ menu at the top of your screen and select ‘Migration Information.’

Next click on the ‘Get Started’ button in the Migration Offer region of the screen.

Finally, fill out the form to sign up and pay for Reclaim Hosting’s services.
