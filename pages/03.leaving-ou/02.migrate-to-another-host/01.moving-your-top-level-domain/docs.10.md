If you registered a top level domain with OU Create, you can migrate that domain to another web registrar.

Transferring a domain you already own is not too much different from registering a new domain, except the transfer process requires an EPP code, or an agreement code between your old registrar and your new registrar that allows the release of your domain.  Your new registrar will have information on how to transfer in a domain.  When you start that process, you will be prompted to enter your EPP code.

How to find your EPP Code:

First you will need to unlock your OU Create account by clicking on the red ‘Locked’ button.

Next click the now green ‘Get Code’ button.  When you click on the ‘Get Code’ button, the system will send you an email with your EPP code.

At this stage, here are a few items to note:

    If you have whois protection enabled, you must disable it temporarily before you initiate the transfer. This is because your new registrar will send an authorization email to confirm the email address paired with your domain. (This is a “are you really sure you want to transfer?” message.)
    You must click the confirmation link in the email, or you will have to start the process over!
    The domain must be older than 60 days.
    The domain must have no other transfers in the last 60 days.
    The domain transfer process can take up to 5 days.

Once you receive confirmation that your domain has successfully been transferred, you can begin setting up your new domain.
