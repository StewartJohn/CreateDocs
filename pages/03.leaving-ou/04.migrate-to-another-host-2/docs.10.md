You are welcome to take the websites and anything else you've built in your domain to another hosting service. To make this easier, we suggest that you create a backup of your OU Create account, and then upload that backup to your new host. 

To export your domain, you will need to access your cPanel.  Login at the top right of the page at create.ou.edu (with OUNetID (4×4) and password).

Once you’re logged in, you’ll see the cPanel interface. It is divided into sections, making it easy to locate the different tools and services available to you.  To export your domain, we will create a backup of both the files in your domain and the databases that your domain draws from.  First click on the ‘Manage Your Account’ menu at the top of your screen and select ‘Migration Information.’

To create a backup of your files and databases, simply click the blue button labeled ‘Add Backup.’  The system will take a moment to create a backup.  When it is complete, you will see the new backup appear below the button.  You can click on this backup to download the file.
