# Leaving OU

If you would like to export your data from your Create account, either because you are migrating your data or because you are closing your account, there are several options.

If you are leaving the university, you can migrate your domain from OU Create to Reclaim Hosting.

If you would like to move to a different hosting service, you can find information below on how to create a backup of your files and databases.  This compressed folder of your domain can then be imported into other web hosting services.

You can also find information on how to export the data from a WordPress installation in order to move it to another WordPress installation or move it to WordPress.com.
